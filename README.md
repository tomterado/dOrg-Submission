# dOrg Activation Challenge

## NFT Quiz Certifcates
Education Quizes + NFT Rewards. 

Have been thinking a lot about education + crypto. Considering the nature of open-source, it has allowed anyone to contribute to DAO's such as dOrg and bounties such as Gitcoin. This is a true democratization of your skill as a human without any societal or economic biases. Decentralization only labels you as an 0x address free of any constraints. 

As an MVP for the dOrg Activation challenge, I created a short quiz on the History of Ethereum and rewards individuals an ERC721 NFT Certificate to validate their knowledge and hard work. 

This could further extend into a certification for your work - Proof of Knowledge. For example:
- You complete a set of Solidity or Product questions for dOrg.
- Once you pass you will be awarded an NFT. 
- To enter the DAO, you validate your address with peepETH or some sort of validator. 
- You are admitted to the DAO for your Proof of Knowledge. 

Many further considerations but can also extend to many areas in education + crypto which I think is cool. 

## Live Demo - Ropsten Network. 
1. You complete 3 questions on the history of ETH
2. If 3/3 you can mint a QUIZ token
3. Forever have a QUIZ NFT token certificate!
